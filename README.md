# What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?


## Both the interface and types helps us to define custom types the way  we want to make a type as per our requirements . but they do have some differences.

 ### Type alias helps us to define a custom type which we can use to define some variables combined type.   Types are normally used for the primitive type data. Types are used with union, tuple and functions. they can be combined and extend using intersection but can not merge like the  interfaces. 

 ### Interfaces are mostly used for defining custom types for objects. They are used for shaping objects structure. it is useful when we are working with objects and classes. Interfaces can be easily extended using merging. same named interface can be merge easily.
