# Blog-1 : What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?


## Both the interface and types helps us to define custom types the way  we want to make a type as per our requirements . but they do have some differences.

 ### Type alias helps us to define a custom type which we can use to define some variables combined type.   Types are normally used for the primitive type data. Types are used with union, tuple and functions. they can be combined and extend using intersection but can not merge like the  interfaces. 

 ### Interfaces are mostly used for defining custom types for objects. They are used for shaping objects structure. it is useful when we are working with objects and classes. Interfaces can be easily extended using merging. same named interface can be merge easily.


# Blog-2: How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?


## As Typescript is mainly built on top of the javascript and it provides us with some more powerful features. which helps the developers to improve the quality and maintain the project easily.

### Typescript is statically typed and provide us with a strong typing system following some strict rules. It's type safety is one of  the most powerful feature that controls the all over typing of any project. As a result variable type error is reduced automatically. In javascript working with large codebase becomes difficult to maintain for naming and typing convention as multiple developer work on that, but in typescript it is very easily maintained. As for type safely imposing it increase the productivity by reducing the bugs. And it requires less testing. Besides it also support the older browser, it is provides more readability improving the overall code quality and maintaining the project easily in any environment.
